# Chroma - Everything you want to do with colors.

`nimble install chroma`

[API reference](https://treeform.github.io/chroma)

This library has no dependencies other than the Nim standard library.

## About

This library works with colors and color spaces. Easly parse and transform colors. Many different color spaces. Optimized, fast and consistant.

## Parse/Format

Common color parsers and formatters:
* `hex` - `FFFFFF`
* `HtmlHexTiny` - `#FFF`
* `HtmlHex` - `#FFFFFF`
* `HtmlRgb` - `rgb(255, 255, 255)`
* `HtmlRgba` - `rgba(255, 255, 255, 1.0)`
* `HtmlName` - `white`
* `HexAlpha` - `FFFFFFFF`
* `parseHtmlColor` - Any of the HTML formats.

## Color Spaces

Conversion from and to these colors spaces:
* 8-bit RGB
* 8-bit RGBA
* CMY colors are reverse of rgb
* CMYK colors are used in printing
* HSL attempts to resemble more perceptual color models
* HSV models the way paints of different colors mix together
* YUV origially a television color format, still used in digital
  movies
* XYZ (CIE `XYZ`; CIE 1931 color space)
* LAB (CIE `L*a*b*`, CIELAB), derived from XYZ (Note: a fixed white
  point is assumed)
* CIELCh, LAB in polar coordinates (type: `ColorPolarLAB`)
* LUV (CIE `L*u*v*`, CIELUV), derived from XYZ (Note: a fixed white
  point is assumed)
* CIELCH, LUV in polar coordinates (type: `ColorPolarLUV`), often
  called HCL
* Oklab (https://bottosson.github.io/posts/oklab/)

The default type is an RGB based type using `float32` as its base type
(with values ranging from 0 to 1) and is called `Color`. All the above
color spaces have corresponding type names of `Color<ColorSpaceName>`,
where `ColorSpaceName` is the name in the bullet points above (unless
specified by "type:" in parenthesis).

Convenience procs to convert from and to the default type `Color` are
provided in the form of
* `proc color(c: Color<ColorSpaceName>): Color`

and the inverse:
* `proc <colorSpaceName>(c: Color): Color<ColorSpaceName>`.

and using the field names:
* `proc <colorSpaceName>(<fieldName1>, <fieldName2>, <fieldName3>: <fieldType>): Color<ColorSpaceName>`

## Color Functions

You can use these to change colors you already have
* `lighten(color, amout)` Lightens the color by amount 0-1
* `darken(color, amout)` Darkens the color by amount 0-1
* `saturate(color, amout)` Saturates (makes brighter) the color by amount 0-1
* `desaturate(color, amout)` Desaturate (makes grayer) the color by amount 0-1
* `spin(color, degrees)` Rotates the hue of the color by degrees (0-360)
* `mix(colorA, colorB)` Mixes two colors together using CMYK

A distance function is provided that implements
[CIEDE2000 color difference formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_difference#CIEDE2000)
* `distance(colorA, colorB)` Distance between two colors

This distance is designed to be perceptually uniform and it can be used to answer the question:
"What is a set of colors that are imperceptibly/acceptably close to a given reference?".
A value of 5.0 is used as reference in [github linguist library](https://github.com/github/linguist/):
any color with distance less than 5.0 from one of the existing colors is not allowed.

## Example

```nim
import chroma

let
    a = color(0.7,0.8,0.9)
    b = color(0.2,0.3,0.4,0.5)

echo a.toHex()
echo parseHex("BADA55")
echo parseHtmlName("red")
echo hsv(b).color()
echo a.darken(0.2)
echo mix(a, b)
```
